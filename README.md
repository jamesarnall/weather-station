# Weather Station

This is just a pet project. It's intended to run on a tablet or similar display
device, as an ambient info source for what the weather is like.

Live app: http://jamesarnall-weather.azurewebsites.net/

## Dependencies

- The DarkSky API
- The DarkSky nuget package
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

## To Do

- [ ] Get better icons
- [ ] Nice animated fade when the display updates?
- [ ] There's no error handling really going on. Might change this, for
  academic reasons.
- [x] Deployment somewhere, presumably Azure. Git hooks, all of that.
